# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose of this repository
The purpose of this project is to gather weather data from 2000 randomly generated coordinates, select a desired temperature range, and then find hotels nearby those coordinates that fit the desired temperature range. From there, I created various maps with markers containing information about hotels and the weather. I then selected four hotels that are close to each other and created a map with a route going to all four of the hotels.
